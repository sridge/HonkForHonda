 You’re on the data science team at Honda. Your team is trying to understand regional automotive demand in the United States, as you plan your manufacturing goals. 

	•	Through some limited market research we’ve discovered a strong regional demand for Honda in Omaha, NE. We’d like to know what other regional markets have similar demand:  . 
	•	What are some promising markets for Honda to expand to? What makes it promising? How do we know that we’re not over saturating the market or expanding into a hostile market?
	•	Are there any other interesting insights or trends that are actionable?

In addition to well-documented, extendable, and reusable code we are looking for a coherent data-story. This is a deliberately open-ended question that provides a chance to showcase your EDA, analysis, and presentation skills. The expectation is that you should spend no more than 4 hours on this task.
